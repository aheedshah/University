# hashTable
This code is an implementation of a Hash Table using linear probing as a method of collision resolution. Here, I am using the function h(x)=(a*k+c)%m where a and c are constants which are provided when the function begins, m is the number of buckets which we can store and k is the key which we are inserting, removing or trying to find.
