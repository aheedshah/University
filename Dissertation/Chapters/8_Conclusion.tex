\chapter{Conclusion}
The development of this web application involved creating a customer-side web app and an applicant-side MVP where an applicant could log in and see a potential match, but an MVP for employers could not be developed due to time constraints. Despite this, the final product met most of the original aims and requirements, except for the latter.

Throughout the development process, tools such as Version Control and rigorous testing, including Functional, Compatibility, Security, and User Testing, were used. Version Control proved really useful as if anything drastic happened with the code, the previous version was safe and could be reverted back to. 

ReactJS and Firebase were also used and worked well together during the implementation. They both were configured correctly and users were able to log in using the data, such as username and password, stored in Firebase. Data stored in Firebase is also rendered on the website correctly.

As mentioned in the Future Works section, while there are other features that still need to be developed before deployment, and some vital parts of the project could not be developed due to insufficient time, the project idea and proposal are sound and worth pursuing in the future.
