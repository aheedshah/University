\chapter{Setting up a database in Firebase}
\label{AppendixA}

To set up firebase, you need to login to the \href{http://firebase.google.com}{Firebase Website} and create an account. A Gmail account is required for Firebase. 

After that, you need to create a new project. For this, you need to go to the Firebase Console and click on "Add a new project". You will then be prompted to register the app within firebase and also set a name for the app in Firebase. After doing that, Firebase provides you with the Scripts to connect Firebase to your Web Application. For my application, this looks like:

\begin{lstlisting}
// Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
// TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
// https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

// Your web app's Firebase configuration
// For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDB6ECgmOtg-27g6N1NhoH3YiRWEZFQL6c",
  authDomain: "jobcrop-f80a0.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "jobcrop-f80a0",
  storageBucket: "jobcrop-f80a0.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "794559361590",
  appId: "1:794559361590:web:2aa2e7feea6619c9de5e97",
  measurementId: "G-SEZEV627SS"
};

// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
\end{lstlisting}

Dependencies for firebase also need to be installed which can be done by "npm install firebase" in the terminal. 

Doing the process above connects the web app to Firebase which can then read and write data to the database. 

Many sign-in processes are supported by Firebase, but for this web app, during the development stages, only email and password was the only that was selected. See figure \ref{fig:sign-in-methods}. But, as this app continues to build, other providers can be added to make it easier for users to log into the app.

After adding Firebase to our Web App, Databases to store data were also needed to be created. This was done in the Cloud Firestore section of Firebase. Cloud Firestore keeps your data in sync across client apps. Databases as stated in the Entity Relationship Diagram in figure \ref{fig: Entity Relationship Diagram} were made as this best suited the database needs. The Databases created are also given below from figures \ref{fig: app-information} to \ref{fig: job-1}.

\newpage
Users are stored in the Authentication section of firebase. For testing purposes and to remain compliant with ethical and GDPR compliance, only one user is made for testing purposes. This is done to make sure no other information from any other individual is stored in the database and to protect testers currently testing the product. The users authentication section can be seen in figure \ref{fig: authentication}.
